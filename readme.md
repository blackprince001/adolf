### About
Adolf is a CLI application that bootstraps a web application in go. Instead of setting up your backend project from scratch, you can use adolf to do that.


### Plans
- Initialize a simple backend application with: 
  - routing, 
  - sample models 
  - controllers.
  - All connected to a database
- Add command line flags to choose the DB of your choice
